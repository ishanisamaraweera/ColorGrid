# ColorGrid
This program is written to identify the largest adjacent colour block nodes of a given colour grid. Here all the colours are represented by numbers and all the nodes identify by a number. If a node in position (x,y) then itâ€™s index will be x*y -1. First node index is zero. Users can create a random colour grid by using the createRandomGrid method if needed or can pass a custom colour grid accordingly. Program returns all the indexes of the result block.
